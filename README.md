[Django-flashpacker](https://github.com/j7nn7k/django-flashpacker) is a mobile first open source blogging package for [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Django-flashpacker offers a plain RESTful api to power mobile or web blogging plattforms. 

This is a web frontend implementation for django-flashpacker.

The project is in a very early stage. We aim to have a functional version running in February.
